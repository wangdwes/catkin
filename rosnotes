ros indigo hosts gazebo 2.2, 
but to use gazebo 4 with ros, refer to:
* http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_wrapper_versions&cat=connect_ros
* http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros

then we'll be able to run gazebo through ros:
* roslaunch gazebo_ros gazebo

issue: roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_model.world: process has died
solution: 1) ps ax | grep gzserver and kill pid.

roslaunch gazebo_ros willowgarage_world.launch
roslaunch gazebo_ros mud_world.launch
roslaunch gazebo_ros shapes_world.launch
roslaunch gazebo_ros rubble_world.launch

* http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_roslaunch&cat=connect_ros
note that the package names are: MYROBOT_gazebo and MYROBOT_description.

* to create a catkin package, refer to 
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/catkin/CreatingPackage

* spawn a model in gazebo
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file ~/catkin-ws/src/evolutus_description/sdf/chimp-head.sdf -sdf -z 0 -model evolutus

* communication: we can control the models via command prompt.

observations: 
* no topics being published by the lidars?
* urdf and sdf compatibility problem?

WHAT I WANT: Lidars publishing messages to some topics.
WHAT I GET: Lidars not publishing messages to some topics.
